NETSCOUT’s disaggregated packet flow switch architecture enables strategic packet visibility that scales and operates dynamically, enabling pervasive visibility with NETSCOUT's InfiniStream® appliances (part of the nGenius® Enterprise Performance Management platform) or security systems, regardless of infrastructure modifications or changes in the source of network traffic. With TAPs and packet flow switches from NETSCOUT, service assurance, security assurance, and other monitoring tools can be physically anywhere and logically everywhere.
