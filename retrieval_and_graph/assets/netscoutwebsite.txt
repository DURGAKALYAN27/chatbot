**Join us** for 20-minute talks in these series: Modernizing Your Observability Strategy and UCaaS and Today's Enterprise Survey Report

## Reimagining Visibility and Control Across Today's Complex Networks

Digital transformations, cloud migrations, SaaS/UCaaS adoption, and the hybrid workforce have increased the connected world's complexity, and visibility gaps have hindered problem resolution. As a result, "Smart Visibility" is essential for isolating end-user experience problems across the transaction path – including remote client, network, cloud, and data center service edges.

nGenius Enterprise Performance Management brings visibility throughout ever-evolving, multi-cloud environments to solve application performance issues affecting digital services across technology and organizational boundaries. nGenius Performance Management solutions assure high-quality end-user experience in any network, location, or service for any user, regardless of where they perform their jobs.

Organizations specifically addressing remote client edge blind spots can start with our nGenius solutions, which provide end-user experience monitoring for UCaaS and SaaS, video conferencing, and custom applications from any business location.

So, what types of features are enterprises looking for these days?

# SDN Performance Monitoring

## Seamless Application Visibility

Digital transformations are being driven by enterprise migrations to Software-Defined Networking. SDN benefits include agility, security, simplified management, and reduced data center costs. Many companies have implemented a Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) to connect remote sites as well as migrating some key services to public clouds.

Visibility is critical for ensuring network performance, especially in complex environments. Without a single source of truth for application dependencies and user experience, it may be impossible to identify the root cause of disruptions before they affect users and overwhelm essential network functions.

NETSCOUT nGenius Enterprise Performance Management solutions enable early detection and rapid resolution of network and application issues and seamless visibility during and after SDN migrations, making it easier to pinpoint the source of performance issues. End-through-end visibility and continuous SDN performance monitoring using NETSCOUT solutions reduces risk to your business operations.

# SaaS Application Performance Monitoring

**Join us** for 20-minute talks in this series discussing research from NETSCOUT's UCaaS Survey Report

![SaaS Application Performance Monitoring](/sites/default/files/2021-03/17/images/CS-014-EN-2101.png)

To maintain productivity and support the hybrid workforce from any environment, the consistent operation and availability of mission-critical Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications is vital. Modern enterprises depend on peak performance of business applications like Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce for CRM, Oracle for timesheets, Certify for expense reports, ADP for payroll, and hundreds more. Simultaneously, the use of Unified-Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) applications like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Webex have become essential for cross-functional collaboration.

As organizations continue to adapt their business models to support the hybrid workforce, seamless user experience is centric to daily operations. NETSCOUT’s performance management solutions provide end-through-end visibility for companies to continuously provide SaaS application performance monitoring that helps maintain business continuity and employee productivity.

# Application Performance Management

Availability and Responsiveness of Mission-Critical Applications

Your employees and customers don’t think about your business in terms of segmented applications and services; they just want to execute a business activity quickly and efficiently, from wherever they may be working. Companies have adapted to meet the demands of the both consumers and the hybrid workforce, with employees and customers accessing application services from diverse facilities and global locations. Additionally, as your IT environment has undergone digital transformations, the complexity of application delivery has increased. Yet, the expectation to deliver responsive and reliable application performance still exists.

Organizations need a holistic approach to enterprise application performance monitoring that spans every possible touch point - from voice and video to a myriad of mission-critical applications. Furthermore, that approach must extend across every border, regardless of whether users are sitting in a home office, corporate headquarters, or a field location.

# UC&C and UCaaS Performance Management

Performance and User Experience Monitoring for Unified Communications and Collaboration

**Join us** for 20-minute talks in this series discussing research from NETSCOUT's UCaaS Survey Report

## Keeping People Connected and Collaborating

Unified Communications & Collaboration (UC&C) and Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) technology needs to be available and reliable from anywhere at any time to support your business or organization as you engage with customers, prospects, partners, vendors, and employees. High-quality UC&C and UCaaS user experiences are critical to customer satisfaction and employee productivity.

Thriving with UC&C means IT Professionals need a complete vendor-agnostic holistic view and robust application performance management capabilities to mitigate risk and keep UC&C and UCaaS applications, platforms and services available and running smoothly.

White Paper

## UCaaS and Today’s Enterprise: The True Cost of Outages and Help Desk Support

Our research shows most enterprises now support at least six or more UCaaS tools and applications. Additionally, 71% say their company increased the number of UCaaS tools over the past year, and the more existing tools a company has, the more likely they are to report adding new ones. So, what types of features are enterprises looking for these days?

## Powering the Modern Workforce

The modern workforce is powered by UC&C and UCaaS solutions, with continued investment in video and web conferencing, VoIP technology, and multi-vendor applications hosted on complex infrastructures. To support global collaboration from headquarters, remote offices, third parties, and more, enterprises and government agencies must monitor the performance of this technology to consistently deliver high-quality user experiences.

NETSCOUT’s rich history of Scalable Deep Packet Inspection, Smart Data Technology and Unified Communications expertise enables us to provide innovative technology, best practices, and continued support to monitor and ensure availability and high performance of complex UC&C and UCaaS environments. Whether in colocations, on-premises, public or private cloud environments, NETSCOUT’s holistic vendor-agnostic approach to performance management provides the visibility organizations need to reduce mean time to restore (MTTR) and protect UC&C and UCaaS technology.

# Network Performance Monitoring Solution

End-Through-End Network Visibility in Complex Environments

![The network is the beating heart](https://play.vidyard.com/ew4oAnZr8zT2BotULqWUwV.jpg)

## Network Performance Monitoring

Maintaining high-performing digital services across distributed hybrid cloud environments is crucial for enterprise IT organizations. Providing both customers and the hybrid workforce with safe, secure access and availability to business applications and services has taken on a new dynamic. In some cases, managing quality performance in the wake of exponential traffic growth across SD-WAN links, crucial internet circuits, VPN gateways, and hybrid cloud has moved from an operational challenge to a business-critical priority.

Today’s organizations require holistic visibility across the service delivery ecosystem to support new access dynamics for all users. Network performance management provides visibility into network activity for tracking and trending traffic and application utilization, which is essential. Enterprise-wide visibility should be an integral part of a broad-based performance and availability strategy that encompasses not only the headquarters, remote offices, and private data centers, but also contact centers, public cloud and SaaS environments.

# VPN & VDI Performance Monitoring

Protect Remote Access Availability and User Experience

![NETSCOUT provides visibility into VPN and VDI performance](https://play.vidyard.com/NfkTcWqKYtaiVHNNudvEv1.jpg)

Digital transformation and the shift to hybrid work models have increased the importance of VPN availability and VDI performance from anywhere, at anytime. Managing the access needs of remote, corporate, and home-based users presents a strategic challenge to IT organizations striving to deliver positive user experiences.

Employees maintain high expectations when it comes to the performance of business applications hosted in data centers, co-los, cloud and/or SaaS environments. nGenius Enterprise Performance Management solutions help assure reliable VPN and VDI performance in any working environment to keep productivity high.

* Flexible hybrid work models and the expansive use of co-los in areas with large employee populations make it more difficult for IT teams to predict traffic patterns. VPN and VDI technology need to be continuously monitored as traffic profiles change due to changing demand and the fluctuating number of home-based workers.
* Applications in the data center are critical to keep the business running, and traffic volumes at the data center's internet gateways are frequently shifting. This volatility underscores the need for packet-level visibility into the data center to keeping applications running at levels expected by the business.

# NetOps and SecOps Tools for Collaboration

Improve network performance and reduce security risks with a consistent source of network-derived data.

Start the Conversation 

## The Need for NetSecOps

Traditionally Network Operations and Security Operations teams have operated in their own silos mainly due to different goals. Network teams focus on facilitating access to information and devices, while security teams focus on limiting access to information and devices. This results in disparate tools and leads to blind spots within the network which bad actors can exploit. Furthermore, if/when a threat is detected, it can take days/weeks/months to investigate and remediate the issue due to lack of communication and collaboration between the two teams. NETSCOUT’s NetOps and SecOps tools and technology improve this collaboration.

Netscout’s Omnis Security Platform is based on a foundation of visibility without borders to provide a single source of smart network derived data (Smart Data) for more efficient service assurance and cybersecurity. The Omnis Security platform gives both NetOps and SecOps the ability to view the same network-derived data, with different lenses, to collaborate and quickly act on that data to prevent further damage to the organization.

## Benefits of our NetOps and SecOps Tools for Collaboration

### Greater Visibility

to fully understand your network and attack surface while increasing your security posture.

### Faster Response

to issues due to the collaboration between NetOps and SecOps, resulting in decreased mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR).

### Cost Savings

with tool consolidation to eliminate redundancies and increase efficiencies.

### Talent Gap

is addressed with cross training opportunities for NetOps and SecOps teams to develop broader skill sets.

White Paper

## A Double-Edged Sword

IT and security teams will be continuing their collaboration for the foreseeable future as work from home and hybrid work styles appear to be here to stay. This white paper focuses on providing a better understanding of the security and service assurance challenges that this new dynamic at the edge presents and what is necessary to address them.

# Adaptive DDoS Protection Solution

An intelligent combination of on-premises and cloud-based protection to mitigate all DDoS attacks.

What is DDoS Latest Threat Intelligence Report Under DDoS Attack? 

![Anti-DDoS Protection Solution](https://play.vidyard.com/HXfS8EEybb5Rs9RsjVPdmS.jpg)

## The Need for On-Premises & In-Cloud Collaboration

NETSCOUT Adaptive DDoS Protection Strategy leverages a robust, always-on, on-premises solution specifically designed to automatically identify and neutralize all types of DDoS attacks against enterprises and service providers. Adapting to the escalating intensity and complexity of cyber threats ensures unimpeded access to your business-critical services. This strategy incorporates intelligent systems that swiftly detect and counteract threats, preventing potential disruptions before they affect the availability and performance of your vital network infrastructure. This proactive approach provides a robust shield, ensuring your enterprise is always protected against evolving cyber threats.

Although traditional cloud-based DDoS protection solutions, including those provided by ISPs or CDNs, are designed to stop large volumetric DDoS attacks, they struggle to eliminate other types of DDoS attacks designed to evade their efforts. Cloud-based DDoS defense solutions augment on-premises protection. On-premises DDoS attack mitigation has capabilities intended to identify and protect against attacks designed to circumvent cloud-based solutions.

Furthermore, due to the dynamic, multi-vector nature of modern-day DDoS attacks, the best practice is to employ both an on-premises and a cloud solution with an intelligent and automated integration that offers dynamic, adaptable DDoS protection.

## An On-Premises Adaptive DDoS Protection Solution Should be a Priority

Industry analysts are coming to grips with the fact that due to today’s growing frequency and dynamic nature of DDoS attacks, the need for a multilayer, adaptable DDoS protection strategy is now a requirement. Furthermore, due to the creation of new attack vectors like Dynamic DDoS Attacks, which change vectors based on the defense that is presented, the need for On-Premises DDoS attack mitigation real-time in-line attack analysis is a priority.

On-Premises DDoS Protection White Paper

![quotation mark](/themes/custom/netscout/images/ns_icon_quote.svg) 

Excellent tool. Before installing NETSCOUT Arbor we were unaware of the amount of unwanted traffic hitting our network. Being able to block these has definitely given our firewall some breathing space.

## Why On-Premises Protection Should Be The Foundation of an Adaptive DDoS Mitigation Strategy

### On-Premises DDoS Attack Protection

NETSCOUT Arbor DDoS Attack protection solution is an intelligently automated combination of in-cloud and on-premises DDoS attack protection that is continuously backed by global threat intelligence and expertise.

On-Premises DDoS Attack Protection Use Case 

### Stopping Application Layer Attacks

Because application layer attacks are typically made up of lower volume traffic, they do not automatically trigger volumetric monitors employed by cloud scrubbing solutions and require on-premise devices like Arbor Edge Defense (AED) to automatically detect and mitigate.

Stop Application Layer Attacks Use Case 

### DDoS Protection for Stateful Devices

Stateful devices within your network like NGFWs, VPN Concentrators, and Load Balancers are common targets for state exhaustion attacks. Protecting them in an always-on manner can only be accomplished with an On-Premise stateless device like Arbor Edge Defense.

Protecting Stateful Devices Use Case 

### Blocking Internal & External C2 Communications

Once an attacker breaches your network, compromised internal devices will communicate with their command-and-control infrastructure for further instructions. Deployed outside your firewall, Arbor Edge Defense (AED) blocks Indicators of Compromise (IoC), acting as a last line of defense for your organization.

Blocking Internal & External C2 Communications Use Case 

### Stopping Attacks in Encrypted Traffic

When cybercriminals embed attacks within encrypted traffic, the only way to detect them is through decryption. Unlike decryption in the cloud, a safer method is to utilize the on-premises, embedded decryption capabilities in Arbor Edge Defense (AED).

Stopping Attacks in Encrypted Traffic Use Case 

### DNS DDoS Protection

DNS water torture attacks rose from an average of 144 daily attacks at the start of 2023 to 611 at the end of June, marking a nearly 353 percent increase in only six months. AED detects DNS attacks based on an increase in NXDOMAIN or SERVFAIL entries in DNS query responses. During the attack, AED provides an effective and unique solution in multiple ways. First, it compares the hostname in every query against the list of auto-learned valid hostnames while also identifying which zones are under attack. Second, if there is a match, the validated traffic is passed. If there’s a miss or an alert, and if it’s in the zones that are under attack, AED blocks that traffic.

DNS Protection with AED 8100

AED has definitely improved uptime for applications that are bringing business value to the company.

# Defending Your DNS Infrastructure with Arbor Adaptive DDoS Protection

From Service Provider to Enterprise, service availability starts with ensuring reliable DNS.

DNS DDoS Protection 

![](https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2023-11/01/images/DNS-and-DDoS%E2%80%93A-Match-Made-in-Hell-thumb.png) 

Read Solution Brief

DNS name resolution services are required both to maintain an internet presence as well as to access online resources. The Domain Name System, or DNS, which serves as the Internet’s address book, maps human-friendly names into IP addresses so that devices, applications, and services know how to find one-another. It is one of the core Internet services enabling the communications we take for granted countless times each day.

However, both authoritative and recursive DNS servers are frequently the target of disruptive DDoS attacks, and undefended DNS servers can also be abused for reflection-amplification DDoS attacks against any organization on the Internet, including that of their owners and operators.

Protecting the availability of DNS is key for any organization providing services or content across the Internet. If the DNS infrastructure is unavailable or slow, services depending on it will be impacted. This is why DNS DDoS protection and mitigation are imperative to keeping these services available.

## Defending DNS with Adaptive DDoS Protection

NETSCOUT has visibility into 50+ percent of all Internet traffic, seeing tens of millions of attacks per year. This threat data is collected in our ATLAS Threat Intelligence system which currently tracks over 1.3 million bots and 500,000 known abusable reflection and amplification systems actively participating in DDoS attacks around the globe.

Knowing the active DDoS participants provides faster detection of attacks, including those that may be below detectable thresholds. This allows for more specific mitigation capabilities instead of the broad, uninformed mitigation used once an attack is detected. 

As DDoS attacks transform either through alternating attacking infrastructure, or a shift in the vectors of an attack, this transformation is tracked and mitigation follows it, learning as it progresses.

The intelligence of knowing the threat landscape, informing detection and mitigation, and learning as attacks transform is Adaptive DDoS Protection, which is paramount in providing precise and effective DNS DDoS mitigation.

# IT Network & Security Monitoring

Optimize and de-risk IT cybersecurity deployments.

## Is Security “Tool Sprawl” Your Hectic Reality?

The threat landscape is constantly evolving and so are the security systems designed to address it. More tools mean more security, right? If only that were true. Unfortunately, evaluating, upgrading, testing, and adding security systems places new demands on security and network operations. The challenges are especially acute when it comes to scaling out security deployments across your networks and data centers. Can your network security systems keep up as you upgrade your networks to 10G, 40G and 100G? Our IT network security visibility tools and software can.

![Woman working at desk with multiple monitors](/sites/default/files/2024-04/01/images/Performance-Monitoring-for-Public-Cloud-Environments-With-NETSCOUT-video-thumb1.png) 

## Pervasive Security Visibility

Packet flow systems from NETSCOUT solve the problem of limited packet visibility by creating a unified packet plane that logically separates security systems from the network, thereby de-risking and streamlining your security deployments. nGenius Packet Flow Systems (PFS) are appliances that optimize the flow of packets from the network to the security monitoring systems.

They perform key flow management functions, such as speed conversion, aggregation, and load balancing, acting as a “traffic cop” and taking the load off your network security systems. At the same time, they ensure uninterrupted network and security monitoring in the event of a power loss or tool failure, so that traffic can be quickly rebalanced, all within one powerful IT network security visibility tool set.

## The Need for IT Network Security & Visibility at Scale 

You need full packet visibility so that your IT network security monitoring systems can perform their job effectively. In order to achieve the highest efficiency, they should only be processing the traffic they are designed the see. Otherwise, precious processing resources are consumed by filtering or load-balancing the packets, before the security logic can be applied to them.

##  nGenius Packet Flow Systems

### Flexibility and Choice

NETSCOUT offers flexibility and choice with its software-driven network packet brokers. These IT network security and visibility tools scale easily and cost-effectively to meet your exact network security and monitoring needs.

### Industry's Highest Capacity

The industry's highest capacity for passive security monitoring—with 6TB of line-rate throughput per chassis.

### Scalability from 1G to 100G

Scalability from 1G to 100G, delivering the highest density on the market in either 100G, 40G, 10G or 1G ports.

### Full Application Monitoring

For active (inline) monitoring, full application health checks and conditional triggers ensure that your security systems perform as designed and that your monitoring infrastructure can automatically respond to any contingencies.

### Customizable Virtual Chain

nGenius software-based tool chaining allows you to place your security systems into a customizable virtual chain. This reduces the port requirement by 50 percent, freeing up ports to connect more systems.

# Private 4G/5G Networks for Enterprise

Achieve Visibility at Any Edge

![How Do I Handle All the Different Deployment Options of Private 5G Networks?](https://play.vidyard.com/YUgpeffJ8mccnzt5VRj6Yr.jpg)

## Assure Critical Business Services

Communications service providers (CSPs) and enterprises have been working to deliver high-performance applications with private 4G (LTE), and they have an opportunity to be even more successful with 5G. Providing high-performance applications through the disaggregation of the public cloud gives them multiple options for deployment. The advent of software-defined network (SDN) virtualization combined with orchestrated container-based microservices provides the ultimate deployment flexibility, scalability, and redundancy for private enterprise 5G.

Whether the private 4G/5G network is located on-premise, off-premise, or a hybrid of those - having end-thru-end service visibility is critical to assuring customer experience and monetizing device and end-user behavior. NETSCOUT solutions provide this visibility to continuously deliver timely and valuable insights across RAN, Edge, and Core, enabling users to explore real-time scenarios, create custom KPIs, and drive informed business decisions using Smart Data. Private 5G has the potential to transform the world as we know it. But the complexity multiplication requires Visibility without Borders.

## **Monitor Performance and User Experience in VMware Environments with NETSCOUT**

![The NETSCOUT / VMware Partnership](https://play.vidyard.com/zeoWXAeTL3RH6dkyMzHfeM.jpg)

NETSCOUT has partnered with VMware to provide visibility for application performance and user experience as digital transformations occur. NETSCOUT and VMware’s initial technology partnership is first-of-its-kind wire-data visibility that, to-date, was unavailable as you moved to a VMware NSX Software Defined Network (SDN).

Migrating to a VMware NSX environment is a major transformation for any enterprise. NSX offers simplified management, micro-segmentation security, provisioning agility, and improved data center economics. As your organization benefits from accelerated service velocity, enhanced security, and rapid disaster recovery, successful migration will depend on overcoming the lack of visibility into application dependencies and user experience. Your bottom line depends on continuous availability and quality end-user experience; anything less, puts your business at risk.

What is needed is a performance management solution that reduces mean time to repair (MTTR), eliminates visibility gaps, and provides a streamlined view that will scale across your VMware ESX, NSX, and SD-WAN deployments, alongside multi-cloud and legacy data center environments.

White Paper

## NETSCOUT Removes IT Visibility Gaps to Assure Performance in VMware Environments

On-prem VMware environments carry many different types of traffic that are often connected to mission-critical applications used by both employees and customers of the enterprise. Applications hosted in VMware environments interact with applications and services hosted on non-VMware platforms, sometimes located in the public cloud and with SaaS providers. NETSCOUT’s nGenius Enterprise Performance Management solutions provide unified visibility network-wide, including traffic inside and outside VMware clusters, which enterprises need to rapidly and accurately identify, triage, isolate and collect evidence of enterprise application problems.

Unrivaled, end-to-end visibility into business application services, along with contextual workflows to speed problem resolution are available with the NSX-T edition of vSTREAM and nGeniusONE, making the solution both easy for a Level 1 responder to use and powerful for an expert to operate. Rather than looking at individual elements in isolation, the nGeniusONE solution offers an overarching view into the performance characteristics of applications and user experience, while validating that micro-segmentation security controls have been properly implemented. These views expose underlying service dependencies that help IT teams to more effectively manage health, availability, security, and user experience issues across their NSX data centers.

* NETSCOUT Support

AWS discontinued its support for multi-AMI offerings in marketplace. As a result, NETSCOUT has replaced the original multi-AMI offerings with single-AMI offerings in AWS Marketplace. For details regarding the migration process, please **contact your NETSCOUT Sales Representative.**

## The NETSCOUT / AWS Technology Partnership

Enterprise organizations are turning to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to meet users’ demands for a fast, seamless, and secure digital experience. AWS uses secure storage, powerful compute, and integrated data analytics to support a new breed of distributed, connected applications, helping businesses cut time to market and improve user experience.

Migrating your applications from on-premises to the cloud takes several steps. Combining this with an increasingly complex infrastructure means that the tools you use on-premises may not provide the service delivery and security insights needed to succeed in the cloud.

As you go on your AWS migration journey, reducing business risk requires NETSCOUT® end-to-end visibility, turning traffic data into Smart Data and measuring your success along the way. NETSCOUT's AWS cloud monitoring solutions deliver the information you need to enhance your corporate security posture and optimize application performance. NETSCOUT keeps your business moving before, during, and after migrating applications to AWS.

## How to Accelerate Deployment of Services with AWS

NETSCOUT uses the industry’s most scalable, lightweight, distributed architecture to generate Smart Data. This data serves as the foundation for providing actionable intelligence, empowering enterprises to confidently migrate workloads to AWS. Through continuous monitoring and by capturing all wire data (traffic flows) traversing the hybrid cloud environment—performing simultaneous deep-packet inspection and real-time analysis—vSTREAM® generates Smart Data at its point of collection. vSTREAM seamlessly operates with NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE solution to gain a centralized view into the performance characteristics of all infrastructure and application components and their dependencies across geographically dispersed data centers and cloud environments.

With valuable and timely intelligence into application performance you can proactively troubleshoot problems.

## How to Solve Security Issues Faster and with Fewer Resources

CyberStream network security sensors convert raw packets into a rich source of data for advanced network threat detection and response. CyberStream is used in combination with Omnis Cyber Intelligence to provide enterprise-wide cybersecurity monitoring, alerting and detection, in-depth triage, and workflows for investigating potential threats.

![NETSCOUT uses the industry’s most scalable, lightweight distributed architecture to generate Smart Data.](https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2023-06/06/images/CS-00388-EN-2301-WEB.jpg)

Arbor Edge Defense (AED) provides an inline, always-on, first line of defense for inbound distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. AED provides a single holistic solution to protect customers’ assets no matter where they are, on-premises, in a private cloud, or in a public cloud. AED blocks bulk inbound and outbound threat traffic to prevent overload of the rest of the virtual security stack (such as a firewall). Additionally, AED blocks and alerts on any traffic leaving the network (at the edge) that it identifies as a threat because, at that point, the traffic has passed the rest of the security stack. Enterprises have often expressed that AED provides the first indication of a critical malware infection.

## Comprehensive Technology Alignment Between NETSCOUT & AWS

![NETSCOUT uses the industry’s most scalable, lightweight distributed architecture to generate Smart Data.](https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2023-12/15/images/CS-00453-EN-2301-WEB.svg)

As shown in the figure, NETSCOUT integrates –or interoperates– with several AWS services and technologies:

* Amazon VPC Ingress Routing
* Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring
* AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
* Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint as a Target
* AWS Security Hub
* Amazon Security Lake

Furthermore, NETSCOUT has achieved critical AWS competencies that are most relevant for attaining the benefits described above including Migration and Modernization, Networking and Security ISV competencies. NETSCOUT is also AWS Public Sector partner.

## Summary

NETSCOUT solutions let you confidently migrate workloads to AWS, and efficiently manage services in hybrid cloud environments by providing a foundation for common situational awareness for NetOps, SecOps, DevOps, ITOps and other IT groups. NETSCOUT achieves this through its scalable DPI-driven monitoring capabilities, covering a range of availability, reliability, security, responsiveness, and threat metrics.

## NETSCOUT & ServiceNow Technology Partnership

![NETSCOUT & ServiceNow Integration](https://play.vidyard.com/5knQpNp1GbNheZP3QVZ8gB.jpg)

Seamlessly integrating IT Operations processes, managed by ServiceNow’s ITOM Health application, with NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE service triage workflows, enables customers to achieve Smarter Outcomes with new levels of operational efficiency, enhanced operational intelligence for IT, and reduced MTTR of IT service issues. This integration creates synergies between the two complementary datasets of ServiceNow’s ITOM CMDB and NETSCOUT’s Smart Data, produced with DPI at Scale. Alerts received by ITOM from a variety of sources, including NETSCOUT and 3rd party platforms, can be investigated in nGeniusONE with contextual launches from ITOM.

NETSCOUT has further integrated with ServiceNow’s ITOM and NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE to mutually enrich nGeniusONE service dependency data with CMDB information from ITOM, and vice versa, to continue reducing MTTR even further and accelerate Smarter Outcomes. Available in the ServiceNow store, this new integration module connects NETSCOUT's nGeniusONE application performance management solution with ServiceNow's ITOM Health application. NETSCOUT and ServiceNow users can utilize this new integration module for a best-of-breed approach to investigating and quickly identifying the root cause of service degradations and faults.

## User Experience

##### Enhanced Service Triage

* nGeniusONE sends alerts to ServiceNow with contextual links back to nGeniusONE for service triage
* Alerts are automatically classified into ServiceNow categories of Alerts/Events/Incidents based on the alarm severity
* The contextual link back to nGeniusONE enables a contextual launch from ServiceNow to nGeniusONE to investigate alerted incidents further
* ServiceNow users can also investigate non-nGeniusONE alerts with a contextual launch into nGeniusONE

##### CMDB Integration

* "Hover over" expanded server information feature: retrieve server class and network device attributes from ServiceNow CMDB
* Includes hostname, class type, manufacturer, serial number, description, CPU, memory, and storage
* Mapping critical classification information to IP address sets performance expectations for host/device

## Key ServiceNow Partnership Benefits

### Expedite Service Triage

Integrated troubleshooting between nGeniusONE and ServiceNow ITOM speeds investigation of network and service issues.

### Flexible Alarm Investigation

Alerts from nGeniusONE or other ServiceNow alerts have contextual launches into nGeniusONE for investigation.

### Enhanced Network Information

NETSCOUT Smart Data and ServiceNow inventory information is combined to provide the most comprehensive network information available.

### Actionable Intelligence

![The nGeniusONE Alert Module delivers interactive dashboard and reporting to view nGeniusONE alerts over time over different time periods to aid in the triaging of critical alerts, events, or incidents.](/sites/default/files/2021-12/15/images/CS-131-EN-2102-%5BWEB%5D.svg) 

Click to enlarge image

The NETSCOUT nGeniusONE Alert integration module enables alerts generated from nGeniusONE to be sent to standard ServiceNow applications with a contextual launch capability that allows ServiceNow users to query back into nGeniusONE for Node, Application, Link, and Service-related triage. Likewise, ServiceNow users can now launch queries into nGeniusONE from any other alert received by ServiceNow ITOM with Node as context.

The nGeniusONE Alert Module delivers interactive dashboard and reporting to view nGeniusONE alerts over time over different time periods to aid in the triaging of critical alerts, events, or incidents.

NETSCOUT Visibility and Advanced NDR App for Splunk Platform

## The NETSCOUT/Splunk Partnership

![Splunk Partnerverse Build Premier](https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2024-03/26/images/splunk-build-elite.png) ![Splunk Partnerverse Cloud Migration Co-Delivery](https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2023-12/11/images/cloud-migration-co-delivery.png) 

As organizations migrate workloads to the cloud, infrastructure becomes more hybrid, making end-through-end visibility a necessary tool in combating threats across the global attack surface. IT teams are tasked with not only assuring service delivery and a delightful user experience but also protecting digital assets from the on-premises data center to the cloud. The sheer sprawl of the IT footprint beyond the boundaries of the traditional enterprise means that NETOPS, SECOPS, and ITOPS must embrace new ways of gaining visibility and addressing both service delivery and security issues as they occur.

NETSCOUT’s partnership with Splunk brings the NetOps and SecOps teams together through a unified view of network and security events from NETSCOUT’s Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI) and nGeniusOne in the Splunk SIEM portal. The NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Intelligence App for Splunk helps you perform security analysis functions. Security events generated from OCI are sent to Splunk with a contextual launch capability that allows Splunk users to query back into OCI for further analysis. The NETSCOUT nGeniusONE Alert integration module enables alerts generated from nGeniusONE to be sent to the Splunk platform. The NETSCOUT and Splunk partnership also features a contextual launch capability that allows Splunk users to query back into nGeniusONE for packet-level performance management and troubleshooting.

Security operations (SOC) teams in every industry vertical need help to secure dynamic infrastructures that span multi-cloud, on-premises, and network edge. Strengthening security and reducing business risk, therefore, requires smart and integrated platforms to illuminate threats everywhere, anywhere, anytime.

As businesses race to the cloud and expand activities across a geographically distributed and hybrid environment, NETSCOUT and Palo Alto Networks have come together as technology partners to enhance an organization's cybersecurity posture and defend this expanded attack surface while enabling SOC teams to reduce administrative efforts and associated costs. Palo Alto Networks solutions integrate seamlessly with several NETSCOUT products, including Omnis Cyber Intelligence, Arbor Edge Defense, and Arbor Sightline.

## The NETSCOUT/Google Cloud Partnership

![Google Cloud](https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2022-02/17/images/cloud-lockup-logo-500px.png)

Enterprise organizations are accelerating their digital transformation with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to achieve revenue and customer satisfaction goals. Whether migrating applications using lift and shift, refactoring existing applications, or developing new apps with microservices, managing the business in the hybrid cloud and GCP relies heavily on an enterprise’s ability to quickly address service performance and security problems as they occur by eliminating visibility "blind spots" in the hybrid cloud.

GCP has become a natural part of how organizations operate and require NETSCOUT end-to-end visibility across the cloud, on-premises data centers, and colos to assure business continuity, service quality, and security. NETSCOUT solutions deliver “Visibility Without Borders,” providing actionable insights to mitigate network and application performance issues, threats, and vulnerabilities.

# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

## **The NETSCOUT / Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Partnership**

NETSCOUT is an Oracle Partner Network Member to provide first-of-its-kind network traffic visibility into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) .

Application and service complexities can threaten or delay successful data transformations from on-premises, centralized facilities to the cloud. Enterprise organizations are accelerating their digital transformation with OCI to achieve revenue, customer satisfaction, and cost-savings goals. Whether migrating applications using lift and shift, refactoring existing applications, or developing new apps with microservices, managing the business on OCI cloud relies heavily on an enterprise’s ability to quickly address issues as they occur, which includes eliminating performance "blind spots."

# The NETSCOUT/ F5 Partnership

Maintaining secure networks and delivering high-quality communications services has never been more important or more challenging as the world emerges from the pandemic and continues its transition to a multi-cloud world that enables digitization. To accomplish that goal IT, Network Operations, Engineering, and Security teams must first have visibility to the network, services, applications, and devices/subscribers running on it. Simply said, you can’t manage and protect what you can’t see!

NETSCOUT's participation in the F5 Technology Alliance program allows it to build, test, certify and offer integrations with F5 via the F5 SSLO Catalog. The new integration between the F5 and NETSCOUT vSTREAM/ISNG provides IT, Network Operations, Engineering, Network Security technicians, Engineers, and Analysts with the ability to collect, investigate and research unencrypted and encrypted network traffic at the packet level.

## Key Benefits

### Observability for Encrypted Traffic

Gain visibility to encrypted traffic with F5 feed to NETSCOUT’s service and security assurance applications.

### Authorized Access to Encrypted Services

Maintain integrity of encrypted services as only authorized service and security applications have access to unencrypted traffic.

### Deploy Encrypted Services with Confidence

Gain visibility to encrypted traffic to assure the delivery of high-quality services.

### Custom App Automated Assurance

Discovery and continuous monitoring of custom applications to ensure SLAs are met.

## User Experience

![NETSCOUT/F5 Partnership](/sites/default/files/2022-06/15/images/vSTREAM_F5_Diagramv2.png) 

Click to enlarge image

When F5 is used in combination with NETSCOUT nGenius Enterprise Performance Management, nGenius Business Analytics, and Omnis Cyber Intelligence products users can perform proactive service assurance and service triage, analytics, and notifications can be enabled to alert network security engineers of threats to the infrastructure.

Figure on the right, depicts the use of an SSL Orchestrator with F5 BIG-IP. In physical environments, SSL Orchestrator can be added as a blade-based function. In a virtual/cloud environment, the SSL Orchestrator module can be enabled as a standalone or add-on software license to the BIG-IP Virtual Edition. In this model, the BIG-IP can provide the ISNG or vSTREAM with copies of client and/or server-side encrypted traffic, through the use of Clone Pools, while the SSL Orchestrator provides decrypted copies of traffic.

Further integration efforts with F5 enable user-controlled business application definitions to be imported directly from F5 BIG-IP server pool definitions. Now BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager can provide NETSCOUT’s ISNG instrumentation with clear, unencrypted traffic for custom applications in both physical and virtual/cloud environments. As these applications typically drive greater revenue, profitability, and competitive differentiation, ensuring a better customer experience, or helping to comply with regulatory requirements, while assuring optimal performance and security is essential.

# Cisco Systems

Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), the worldwide leader in IT, helps companies seize the opportunities of tomorrow by proving that amazing things can happen when you connect the previously unconnected.

## **The NETSCOUT/Cisco Solution Partnership**

Building on a long history of joint technology development, Cisco and NETSCOUT continue to deliver value-added solutions to provide network and service delivery assurance with Cisco Unified Communications and Collaboration (UC&C).

Complementary to the management capabilities of Cisco, NETSCOUT solutions bring incremental value to joint Cisco and NETSCOUT customers and build on a base of synergistic customer and channel relationships.

## **nGeniusONE for Cisco Unified Communications and Collaboration**

UC&C management capabilities are part of the nGeniusONE Enterprise Performance Management solution and have specific support for Cisco Unified Communication (UC) IP telephony and Cisco Jabber technologies often adopted for collaboration services. Once adopted, these Cisco UC&C services become critical for business and require high availability and performance.

The nGeniusONE solution, with NETSCOUT’s innovative smart data technology, is uniquely capable of providing deep, comprehensive insights into the root cause of service quality issues with Cisco’s UC&C solution. Using contextual workflows, the precise location and source of service degradation can be easily identified with the help of system-wide visibility. This ultimately reduces mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR), keeping the UC&C infrastructure operating at peak performance.

![nGeniusONE for Cisco Unified Communications and Collaboration](https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2023-10/04/images/CS-00330-EN-2301-WEB.svg)

The nGeniusONE solution correlates Cisco CDR data with real-time granular per-user, per-session assessments from midpoint locations.

### Defend Your Network at Scale with Smart Protection

Learn more 

As a communication, cloud, or internet service provider, maintaining network and service availability is paramount to the success and reputation of your organization. One of the biggest threats you face, not only on your backbone network but also in the networks used to run your internal IT infrastructure, is a DDoS attack. Year after year, the size, frequency, and complexity of dynamic DDoS attacks continue to increase – and so too does the risk of downtime to you and your customers.

To protect you and your customers’ services from sophisticated, modern-day, multi-vector DDoS attacks, you must rely upon an adaptable DDoS protection provider that bases its defense on actionable threat intelligence and orchestrated mitigation.

For over 25 years, the largest service providers have relied upon NETSCOUT's Arbor DDoS attack protection products and expertise to eliminate network/service downtime costs and generate revenue by delivering managed DDoS attack protection services to their customers.

### Pervasive Network Visibility and Adaptable DDoS Attack Detection

### Highly Scalable, Surgical Mitigation

Arbor Threat Mitigation System (TMS) is an Intelligent DDoS Mitigation System (IDMS) that can stop all types of DDoS attacks including large reflection/amplification attacks, state exhaustion or application layer attacks that require advanced, active (i.e. challenge/response) countermeasures. TMS mitigation capacity can scale from sub 1 Mbps to 400 Gbps in a single appliance or up to 40 Tbps in a clustered deployment.

Arbor TMS

### Intelligently Orchestrated DDoS Attack Mitigation Provider

The modern-day DDoS attack can be large (e.g. multiple Tbps in size) and complex (e.g. hundreds of Mpps and simultaneously uses 30+ attack vectors). Stopping these attacks takes multiple, simultaneous methods of DDoS mitigation. Arbor Sightline with Sentinel can intelligently orchestrate multiple methods of attack mitigation including Flowspec, Arbor TMS and even coordination with an upstream ISP to provide optimized and controlled protection.

The entire Arbor DDoS attack protection solution is continuously armed with global threat intelligence and expertise from the NETSCOUT ASERT Team. Our ATLAS global sensor network currently monitors 424 Tbps of internet traffic and knows more about DDoS attack activity and best practices in defense than all other vendors.

# Carpet Bombing DDoS Solution for Service Providers

Adaptive DDoS Protection provides advanced, automated detection and mitigation.

**Webinar:** What is a "Carpet-Bombing" DDoS Attack and How Can you Mitigate the Impact – Watch Now

![DDoS attack traffic mitigation diagram](/sites/default/files/2024-02/29/images/CS-00465-EN-2401-WEB.svg) 

## The Challenge of Carpet Bombing Attacks

Carpet Bombing DDoS attacks target many destination IP addresses at once. This creates several advantages for the attacker as well as challenges for the defender.

Firstly, the attacks are more difficult to detect because traditional DDoS protections focus on protecting specific hosts or customers and their IP address space. Because carpet bombing spread out the attack the resulting traffic tends to fall below thresholds for individual destinations that would trigger an alert. Also, the attack can starve resources upstream by attacking thousands of hosts that may not otherwise merit protection.

Secondly, carpet bombing created a challenge for defenders because it is difficult to mitigate attack traffic for so many destinations at once. Further, it can require significantly more mitigation capacity to inspect the traffic for all of the destinations being attacked simultaneously, instead of a single target.

![Dark red background with brighter red fiber optic light wires](/sites/default/files/styles/large_wide_lazy_load/public/2020-03/16/images/Product_Cat_DDoS_%5B1600x900%5D.jpg?itok=sgTlNo_k "DDoS Product Hero") 

Solution

### Adaptive DDoS Protection

Prioritize Your Defense 

## Detect and Mitigate Automatically

Adaptive DDoS Protection (ADP) for TMS introduces a new type of DDoS alert: a Managed Object Misuse alert, designed to detect and mitigate Carpet Bombing DDoS attacks automatically.

This feature measures total DDoS misuse traffic for entire network, not just per-host, and includes Known Attacker Detection based on total traffic by misuse type. It detects the total volume of DDoS misuse traffic no matter how distributed among many destinations.

ADP analyzes attack destinations to determine specific subnets needing mitigation and redirect subnets to Arbor TMS. It continues to automatically update the mitigation in real time as attack targets change.

## Why NETSCOUT is Better Than Other Solutions

Advanced DDoS Protection solutions for service providers detect DDoS attacks at any granularity, whether they target a single destination or many at once. The detection engine intelligently identifies specific subnets of the network under active attack and optimizes the mitigation automatically. ADP redirects only attack traffic for active targets at any given time. It uses Known Attacker Detection to detect smaller attacks faster and more accurately than other solutions. Block known, active sources of DDoS attack traffic (e.g. specific IP addresses, botnet hosts) based on real-time global ATLAS Threat Intelligence. Arbor TMS with ADP and ATLAS Intelligence Feed (AIF) fully and efficiently mitigates carpet bombing attacks!

### Carpet Bombing Alert Threshold Assistant

Carpet Bombing Alert Threshold Assistant makes it easy to set up effective carpet bombing DDoS attack detection. It reports on traffic by misuse type across the network. It shows current settings compared to actual traffic and suggests new settings based on observed traffic that can be applied rapidly or automatically.

### Customizable TMS Diversion

Customizable TMS diversion provides precision mitigations for optimum performance and efficiency. While redirecting large subnets can conflict with existing customer routes, Arbor Sightline automatically redirects the most specific subnets possible to divert carpet bombing DDoS attacks. The new diversion customization settings allow users to control both the minimum and maximum size of the announcements.

### Integrated with Known Attacker DDoS Intelligence

Integration Known Attacker DDoS Intelligence drives Adaptive DDoS Protection based on industry leading global attack visibility. It includes current DDoS attack sources such as active reflectors/amplifiers and abused open proxies. It also contains persistent attack sources like known DDoS botnet members and other sources including “Bulletproof” Hosters and Tor exit nodes.

### Why Flowspec is _Not_ an Effective Solution

A traditional DDoS flowspec response blocks only some carpet bombing attack vectors like certain types of reflection/amplification and initial IP fragments. Rate limiting could possibly be applied to non-initial fragments and UDP traffic. However,under attack these countermeasures can easily overwhelm resources on the routers and will still require the use of robust and precision mitigation solutions like Arbor Threat Mitigation Systems (TMS).

## 5G is Forcing a Fundamental Shift in Operational Focus

The advent of 5G is forcing a fundamental shift in operational focus from Performance, Reliability and Coverage, adding Security as a key tenet. Mobile broadband has become the Internet on-ramp of choice for millions of subscribers; but as more home and small office infrastructure transitions to using mobile connectivity, the same risks to service availability and quality that have plagued wireline networks for years are coming to MNOs (mobile network operators).

MNOs are now challenged with:

1. Managing increasing threat activity from consumer fixed wireless access, IoT, gaming, and non-NAT services, etc.
2. Achieving scalable, granular, cost-effective visibility into fast growing user plane traffic.
3. Ensuring identity attribution for accurate threat mitigation and reporting.

# Cloud Visibility:  
See It All or Risk It All

With NETSCOUT’s Visibility Without Borders, gain visibility into your hybrid network and applications with our cloud optimized software. Seamless visibility to on-prem, private and public cloud, virtualized networks.

## Gain Cloud Performance and Visibility

Hybrid cloud is the ideal IT model for today’s digital business climate. Allowing users to choose the appropriate workload environment also allows them to shift workloads in step with the evolving needs of an organization by moving data and computing workloads across private, public, and third-party clouds. However, hybrid cloud systems can also pose complex IT architecture and security challenges for larger enterprises.

![Service Provider Cloud Visibility Diagram](/sites/default/files/2021-03/03/images/CS-186-EN-2001_smaller.png "Service Provider Cloud Visibility Diagram")

5G is assured to bring major improvements to the cloud computing world. Carriers themselves are leveraging the cloud to make 5G networks more secure and seamless, ultimately delivering faster speeds, lower latency, and greater capacity for more compute-intensive applications.

With the most 5G and cloud deployments, NETSCOUT is uniquely positioned to assist communications service providers (CSPs) and enterprises with unmatched visibility.

### Gain a complete view within and between:

* Physical network (5G, 4G, LTE, data centers)
* Private Clouds (5G, Kubernetes, OpenStack, VMWare)
* Public Clouds (5G, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud)
* Edge (5G, Client, Service, Servers)

![Multi-Cloud Visibility for Service Providers](/sites/default/files/2021-03/03/images/NETSCOUT_CSP%20Web%20Diagrams_Provides%20Complete%20Visibility_540px.png) 

## High Definition Multi-Cloud Visibility

In hybrid networks there must be visibility across all network implementations to assure the high-quality delivery and security of applications and services. Whether the cloud implementations are on-prem or in public clouds, deployed in containers, virtual machines, having visibility within a pod and between pods and virtual machines along with traditional centers is essential. Our unique value is creating smart data from this deep visibility that provides both granular and service level views.

![Cloud Visibility for Service Providers](/sites/default/files/2021-03/03/images/CS-007-EN-2102-%5B1100px%5D.png)

## Visibility is Mission Critical to Growing Revenue

Extend your reach with full visibility into Edge services, cloud availability zones, cellular, and IP networks. See every communication between different virtualized networks, all on a single pane of glass.

Having a seamless and proactive view of the network for service assurance means Operations can rapidly identify, triage and isolate issues that impact services from degradation to outages reducing Meant Time To Repair (MTTR) from days to minutes.

### Service Providers: Are You Cloud Confident?

Watch Now 

## Moving Towards Cloud Native

Cloudification of the network is moving forward with Containerization, Kubernetes-like environments with orchestration and service meshes, along with virtual machine based micro services.

NETSCOUT provides complete visibility to microservice, pod, pod-to-pod communications, and in 5G environments where encryption is involved. Migrating services to the cloud and managing a hybrid, multi-cloud network is confidently assured with NETSCOUT.

![Cloud Optimized Visibility Software](/sites/default/files/2021-03/03/images/iStock-880444184-2-%5B1600x900%5D.jpg) 

## NETSCOUT’s Cloud Optimized Software

Our Cloud Native design means having software optimized for the cloud and service mesh as part of the service architecture. With service mesh support comes multi-vendor encryption/decryption addressing the challenge of common encryption. DevOps faces an encryption challenge in service development but by leveraging service mesh and NETSCOUT visibility that is solved.

## NETSCOUT Supports All Versions of Kubernetes

## Hybrid networks and VNF management will be challenging

Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) enables service providers to be more efficient and launch services faster than ever. However, the dynamic nature of NFV adds incredible complexity to network management and operations. Compounding the problem is the fact that virtual network functions (VNFs) do not usually operate in isolation, but rather work alongside existing physical network functions. This hybrid network approach makes assuring the reliability and availability of networks and services more challenging, and even more critical to achieve.

### Complete visibility is the key to NFV success

NFV deployment makes perfect sense – it will allow you to simplify your network operations and lower operational costs, but once a service is virtualized, how can you be sure it’s performing as it should? With a universe of activity out there, you need a seamless view across your virtual and physical networks. Visibility into VNF performance through packet data analysis of the traffic flowing across your entire network is absolutely critical to successful NFV deployments.

### NETSCOUT’s Service Assurance for NFV

NETSCOUT’s NFV Service Assurance solution helps service providers manage this complex and dynamic environment with correlated, end-to-end, 360° visibility across the entire network. Our InfiniStream family of products include virtual, COTS-based software and appliance-based instrumentation that provides a single view across virtual, physical and hybrid environments, enabling us to pinpoint the exact location of an issue, wherever it occurs.

NETSCOUT’s patented Adaptive Service Intelligence technology (ASI) analyzes wire data in real time for valuable insights into the performance of your virtualized services. ASI’s multi-dimensional smart data ensures high-performance and cost-effective NFV service delivery - and is the most valuable data source for virtual machine orchestration.

![NFV Service Virtualization Monitoring](/sites/default/files/company-L2_about_NETSCOUT-1200x675_0.jpg) 

NETSCOUT supports OpenStack® + KVM and VMware® Cloud environments, providing visibility to critical network data that is lost when operators virtualize key network functions. This allows administrators to use the full suite of OpenStack and VMware administrative tools to orchestrate the NETSCOUT virtual probes and the VNFs monitored by them. 

### Network virtualization implementations vary

We understand that NFV evolution looks different for every service provider. Whether NFV is being implemented to add EPC and IMS network capacity, or to add new services and applications for customers, NETSCOUT delivers the information you need, when you need it, ensuring the best customer experience. Wherever you are in your NFV journey, NETSCOUT can help minimize the disruptions caused by NFV transformation.

### Talk to an expert

Assuring the performance of virtualized network functions and services will be challenging for service providers. Speak to one of our highly experienced subject matter experts to get the insights and answers to help ease your NFV transition.

# LTE , VoLTE and VoWi-Fi Monitoring

Satisfy Subscribers with Quality Voice and Data Experiences

![ -Win-the-LTE-Turn-thumb.jpg](/sites/default/files/styles/large_wide_lazy_load/public/2023-04/25/images/-Win-the-LTE-Turn-thumb.jpg?itok=qlZwYUUQ) 

Data Sheet

### LTE Monitoring 

Read More 

## How Reliable Are Your LTE and Wi-Fi Networks?

Your LTE and Wi-Fi networks are the foundation for your next-generation, digital voice, and data services by providing scalability, increased capacity, and speed. Each can prove to be a massive technology turn filled with challenges. LTE and Wi-Fi deployments require huge commitments, accompanied by aggressive schedules and fierce competition. Ultimately, performance will define success, profitability, and customer satisfaction.

Subscribers are eager for service, but they have high expectations. Ensuring quality LTE and Wi-Fi service requires expert analysis of network performance, service delivery, and subscriber behavior. How do your LTE and Wi-Fi networks measure up?

## Benefits

### Proactive Monitoring

End-to-end visibility and insight assured the highest levels of LTE, VoLTE, and VoWi-Fi performance.

### Real-Time Visibility

Keep constant watch over your Wi-Fi access points, and LTE access, core and roaming networks.

### Multi-Technology, Multi-Domain

Reduce overall troubleshooting costs and accelerates time-to-market.

## Proactive Monitoring is Key to Voice Service Delivery

Troubleshooting tools must provide end-to-end correlation of control and user plane with visibility from device-to-content. The right performance tools should offer measures of service assurance and media QoE, while customer experience tools should be able to evaluate behaviors to drive service offerings. Having real-time visibility to both the signaling and media quality at each network hop allows service providers to take early action on any degradation.

VoWi-Fi enables service providers to expand their footprint without adding towers, and allows more efficient management of radio and network resources. Successful service delivery demands complete understanding of Wi-Fi access point health, performance, and user experience metrics, such as authentication, connection time, throughput, and latency. Maintaining service continuity requires early warning signals to help avoid outages and over saturation of Wi-Fi access points.

![VoLTE & VoWi-Fi Monitoring](https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2023-02/23/images/techwebinars-manwithcomputer-1200X675.jpg "VoLTE & VoWi-fi Monitoring")

## Voice is Still a Killer App

No matter what device, applications or services are used, first and foremost, subscribers still expect to be able to make phone calls. Whether calls are made via VoLTE or VoWi-Fi networks, subscribers anticipate a voice experience with high-definition voice quality, improved coverage, and continuous service. Ensuring crystal clear voice connections requires real-time visibility of the traffic flowing over your LTE network and Wi-Fi access points.

![LTE Monitoring](https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2023-02/23/images/article-service-provider-man-phone-street-1200x480.jpg "LTE Monitoring")

## Accelerate and Assure Success of VoLTE and VoWi-Fi Rollouts 

Spanning multiple network technologies and domains, VoLTE, and VoWi-Fi enable many different types of services and the creation of new revenue opportunities. While the benefits of both may be clear, successful delivery comes with significant challenges. The good news is you don’t have to go it alone. NETSCOUT’S nGeniusONE Service Assurance platform allows you to proactively monitor your LTE, VoLTE, and VoWi-Fi services from a single service assurance solution – with the visibility needed to ensure the highest levels of performance. Our Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology delivers critical insights that enable you to improve network and service performance with detailed IP-level views into the control and user planes, and insights into subscriber usage and behavior.

# Proactively Manage Your Network with OTT Visibility

Whether you’re a Mobile Network Operator (MNO), Cable/Fixed Provider, Internet Service Provider (ISP), or a Communications Service Provider (CSP), visibility into your OTT applications is paramount.

## Networks Face New Challenges

* Network performance once optimized for specific devices, peak times and applications demand re-evaluation and reprioritization to avoid unnecessary spending and knee-jerk infrastructure build-out
* Your subscribers changing behavior as to how they are using your network to entertain themselves, conduct business, and connect with each other
* Accelerated trial, uptake and use of third-party OTT applications is driving complexity with unpredictable network behavior and congestion-causing bandwidth consumption putting your own revenue-generating services and applications at risk

**Gain real-time visibility to all network traffic and cost-effectively manage resources, prioritize service delivery performance, and meet changing customer expectations.**

## NETSCOUT OTT Analytics & Visibility Solutions

NETSCOUT's Smart Visibility allows network operators to characterize, analyze, and troubleshoot the OTT traffic on their networks. As a leader in network monitoring, we have invested heavily in OTT for your use cases: OTT analytics for Mobile Operators, OTT for hybrid networks, and OTT for Internet Service Providers.

# Automated Analytics: A New Approach  
for Service Providers

A Paradigm Shift in Actionable Business Intelligence

![Service Provider Automation](/sites/default/files/2022-01/24/images/CS-113-EN-2102-WEB-1.png) 

## A Paradigm Shift In Actionable Business Intelligence Delivering Automated Operations Efficiency

_Network complexity is increasing exponentially with the introduction of_ _5G_ _, IoT, VoNR, Network Slicing, Edge Computing, and Cloud Migration, while still focusing on 4G, VoLTE, Voice, WiFi, Fixed Line and Video services._

Wouldn’t it be nice to have an Automated Consultant that reduces the complexity of determining service impact across the entire network for every single service and every single subscriber? Typically, this involves multiple groups and possibly teams of people with deep domain knowledge across multiple disciplines sorting through hundreds of KPIs, KQI’s and metrics manually.

## NETSCOUT’s Smart Data and Borderless Visibility is the Cornerstone of Advanced Service Provider Automation and Analytics

A strong data foundation and deep packet level visibility is required before constructing an Automation Intelligence layer. Leveraging NETSCOUT’s Smart Data solves the traditional barriers to using packet level data, providing a deep understanding of the communications between service, infrastructure, and characteristics, regardless of the physical location of the data concerned. We provide a high performance and easily deployable, light weight architecture that collects and processes data at the source to deliver consistent, real-time visibility across the entire infrastructure.

## The Power of This Seamless Visibility Architecture Allows NETSCOUT to Announce a New Automation Solution – Automated Analytics

Automated Analytics is a paradigm shift that goes beyond the human reach - an intelligent automation engine running millions of iterative sequences and isolating the root issues that have the greatest business impact on subscribers and their service quality.

* Offering a unique blend of AI/ML algorithms injected with 30+ years of domain knowledge from service providers around the globe driven by our ASI Smart Data to provide actionable business intelligence.
* Performs deep outlier detection along with cross correlation through the entire network to direct you to the precise primary and possible secondary issues. Providing supporting evidence that are affecting VIP’s, Market, Gateway, Service, Enterprise Customers, 5G Slice, UE’s, firmware version, eNodeB, gNodeB... any aspect of your network that NETSCOUT is monitoring with our nGenius Platform.
* Provides greater overall efficiency and minimizes human error by comparing possible issues across millions of scenarios, while reducing cost associated with data overload. All while providing faster results that is close to impossible for a team of humans to resolve in a timely manner.
* This is automated intelligence applied to your entire network providing concise, top-down prioritized impactful data that can be displayed visually, place on a Kafka bus or sent to external business messaging applications.

## Service Provider Automation Applications

Automated Analytics are built on top of the proven nGenius platform. nGenius is a scalable platform that brings together best-of-breed technologies (ISNG for the creation of Smart Data, nG1,  and nSA for Service Assurance and analytics). The ability to run these applications on top of the existing nGenius platform, means that customers get a low cost/high ROI advanced analytics solution.

Automated Analytics provide a holistic analytics solution. Many analytics solutions focus only on what’s broken or what’s not working, whereas our applications bring not only what’s broken or impacting business, but it also looks at what’s working well and how services and customers are behaving.

### Why You Should Care about Carrier Aggregation

Watch Video 

## Automatically Engineer the RAN Network for Growth and Performance

You’ve made significant investments in rolling out LTE-Advance and 5G networks to support growing subscriber demands, complex services and revenue generation targets.

Keep the momentum going and assure success with a comprehensive solution designed to address the complexities of the RAN and enable large scale automation initiatives. With correlated, mediated, AI-digestible metadata sets, NETSCOUT’s RAN Optimization and Automation solutions empower service providers to resolve and fine-tune critical carrier capacity, coverage, and quality issues.

# Diverse NEM Offerings Lag Behind Technology Innovations

New architectures are paving the way for the introduction of new gNodeBs and 5G-enabled handsets and network equipment manufacturers are working around the clock to win business with leading service providers. Unfortunately, these initial NEM offerings will be limited with basic 5G functionality and growing operational gaps.

To address the inevitable disconnect, service providers need automation tools that can help them deploy and cost-effectively tune complex, new RAN architectures and troubleshoot interoperability.

## NETSCOUT Delivers Industry-Leading Value  
with RAN Optimization and Automation

## Great Mobile Experiences Rely on RAN Performance

No matter how well the core network is performing, issues in the RAN often lead to significant quality of experience (QOE) or Quality of Service (QoS) problems. Empowered with a deep understanding of the RAN, Carrier Service Providers (CSPs) can build and tune better performing access networks, proactively resolve emerging problems and reduce the risk of widespread, debilitating subscriber churn.

Increasing quality expectations around existing 4G services (mobility, data, VoLTE and video) and the evolution to 5G and cloud architectures only magnify the complexity of RAN innerworkings that contribute to issues including latency, reliability, and signaling overhead.

To meet these new challenges, LTE & 5G RAN planning and operations teams rely on NETSCOUT solutions to protect and accelerate time to market, identify and resolve network degradation and efficiently triage fault isolation across cross functional teams.

## Ensure the Success of 5G Planning and Deployment

NETSCOUT’s RAN monitoring and troubleshooting applications are deeply rooted in field-proven best practices. Delivering reliable, life cycle network planning, operations and optimization strategies, NETSCOUT addresses the holistic needs of 4G/5G, Cloud and Open RAN networks.

# GeoMarketing Solution

Increasing Carriers’ Revenue with AI/ML Geolocation

## Expand Your Market with GeoMarketing

Communication Service Providers (CSPs) face revenue growth challenges, including declining Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU). GeoMarketing from Netscout provides a way to meet these challenges.

Our GeoMarketing using the Automated Analytics RAN Machine Learning Precision Module utilizes new algorithms and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) to significantly enhance subscriber geolocation accuracy with 40% greater precision than existing passive algorithms, including indoors. It provides opportunities to increase top-line revenue through subscriber location-based services (LBS) that can increase ARPU without the need for GPS.

![Animating charts from red to black](/sites/default/files/2021-11/03/images/Final_1.2021-10-20%2014_32_42.gif) 

## Mobile Operator Monetization Strategies

Lean on Netscout for precision and experience. We have provided business and marketing teams around the world with successful LBS. These carriers are taking advantage of insights and monetization opportunities that include tourism, government, finance, marketing, and advertising.

![Mobile Operator Monetization Opportunities](/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-103-EN-2101-WEB-02.png "Mobile Operator Monetization Opportunities")

![quotation mark](/themes/custom/netscout/images/ns_icon_quote.svg) 

Our advanced algorithms on top of our smart data platform enables MNOs to provide the transformational experience subscribers expect. With increased precision for real-time geolocation and usage data, MNOs can increase revenue opportunities for location-based services. In addition, while the disaggregation of RAN and Core often leads to finger-pointing, our end-to-end analytics eliminate that issue to reduce MTTK.

\- Sanjay Munshi, VP of Products at NETSCOUT

## Guarantee Superior Voice Quality 

Unlike data services, consumers have expectations around voice service and meeting those expectations can be challenging. A consistent quality voice service experience requires visibility into the IP network and clarity around how service enablers are working together with the IMS core.

Detailed IP-level insights into the control and user plane, end-to-end visibility, and assurance across subscriber, network, and service domains improve understanding of the voice service experience.

![Fixed Network Solutions](https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-09/14/images/Guarantee-Superior-Voice-Quality%20-%5B1600x900%5D.jpg "Fixed Network Solutions")

## Maintain Visibility Across Virtual Infrastructures

As elements of the network migrate from physical hardware into virtual infrastructure and the cloud, the network becomes more complex – and assuring service delivery becomes increasingly more difficult. Critical insights are needed to ensure a flawless user experience.

Virtualized functions provide key functionality such as authentication services, routing and switching functionality, and domain name services (DNS). Applying NETSCOUT’s solution can create visibility to assure the overall user experience and prevent customer churn.

## Accelerate and Assure SD-WAN Deployment Success

In moving to an SD-WAN solution, organizations stand to gain tremendous flexibility and agility in their IT infrastructure, but they also take on significant risk as traffic is often carried over “best effort,” broadband access networks. End-through-end application visibility is a critical component of our Cable/MSO provider and fixed line network FTTH/FTTX solutions that contributes to understanding and maintaining a high-quality user experience.

With enterprises actively investing in SD-WAN as a cost-effective and preferred means to connect branch offices and other fixed locations to the corporate network and enable higher quality, real-time applications, assuring and protecting the end-user experience is both complex and necessary.

NETSCOUT’s vendor and technology agnostic solution delivers end-through-end application visibility and proactive monitoring of LAN/WAN traffic flowing through the VNF service chain.

Automation for IoT 

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting Solutions Prioritize IoT Device Performance

IoT communications and services rely on the accessibility, connectivity, and reliability of the underlying protocols, access technologies, and networks.

With many applications sitting in the cloud, service providers need visibility and toolsets to identify and resolve issues and keep devices and services in sync and operational.

Service Assurance for IoT 

### Protection from Attacks and Risk Mitigation

The volume and diversity of IoT devices increases a service provider’s vulnerability to malicious activity.

From hijacked security feeds to the rise of botnet devices that compromise infrastructure from within the service provider network, threat detection and mitigation is paramount to profitability and end-user privacy. 

Security for IoT 

## Assuring Profitability for Smart Car Connectivity

![CSP IoT Device Visibility](/sites/default/files/2022-10/05/images/Smart%20Car_591685676-1600x900.jpg) 

With the global connected car market expected to reach a value of US$156.6 Billion by 2027\*, service providers will be looking to take advantage and manage profitable partnership opportunities with major automotive manufacturers.

Offering internet connectivity and advanced communication technologies, connected cars generate traffic between a variety of devices and data centers across the service provider network with the goal of improving vehicle performance, entertainment options and, in some cases, early warning to road hazards. In addition to providing onboard WiFi internet to passengers, today’s connected cars access/send data, download software updates/patches and connect with other IoT devices.

NETSCOUT IoT monitoring solutions help service providers maximize the benefits from relationships within the automobile industry to provide and guide secure, uninterrupted connectivity and assure trouble-free software updates for major car manufacturers.

## NETSCOUT TAPs and nGenius Packet Flow Switches

Dynamically Connect Any TAP Point in the Network to Any Tool

Scalable Architecture Provides Seamless Growth with Investment Protection

Easy-to-Use Management Platform Provides a Single Plane of Glass to the Monitoring Fabric

## Features

* Scalable Network Visibility  
As your networks and traffic volumes grow, so too should your readiness to respond to issues as they arise.
* Active Inline Security  
Inline packet flow switch deployments enable a pervasive defense architecture for inline and passive network protection.
* Decryption for Inline or Passive Tools  
Inline or passive decryption gives visibility in the face of pervasive encryption.
* Eliminate Disruption to Traffic or Protocol Transactions  
Simplify traffic acquisition and distribution for diverse network monitoring applications including performance management, service delivery management, and security monitoring.

The NETSCOUT nGenius® packet flow switch (PFS) and TAPs family enables multiple IT groups to aggregate, replicate, and manage the flows of traffic throughout the monitoring network, whether it’s for application performance monitoring, unified communications (UC), or security. Traffic management and security enablement capabilities ensure risk-free deployment of inline security and threat detection systems.

Scalable Network Visibility

As your networks and traffic volumes grow, so too should your readiness to respond to issues as they arise.

In the ongoing race to stay ahead of advanced persistent threats and and continually improve cybersecurity posture and capabilities, organizations must take a proactive approach. NETSCOUT packet flow switches provide critical visibility to combinations of security solutions, such as inline network protection and passive out-of-band intrusion detection appliances, as well as active payload analysis offerings.

PFS systems, in an active-protection deployment, increase reliability and simplify scale out. If any active inline security applications fail, they may be bypassed or traffic can be sent to another system. A unified visibility plane enables you to implement multiple security systems and create a pervasive defense architecture against a broad range of attacks.

Active Inline Security

Inline packet flow switch deployments enable a pervasive defense architecture for inline and passive network protection.

Purpose-built decryption/encryption provides low latency, high performance visibility into encrypted traffic. Inline and passive deployment models give architectural flexibility while supporting the latest encryption standards.

Decryption for Inline or Passive Tools

Inline or passive decryption gives visibility in the face of pervasive encryption.

By combining industry-leading NETSCOUT nGenius packet flow switches, passive and bypass TAPs, and our highly flexible nGenius PFS management platform, NETSCOUT simplifies traffic acquisition and distribution for diverse network monitoring applications including performance management, service delivery management, and security monitoring. Our robust family of passive TAPs provides InfiniStream appliances (powered by Adaptive Service Intelligence® (ASI) technology) and nGenius packet flow switches with full access to network traffic, while remaining transparent to the networking infrastructure and eliminating disruption to traffic or protocol transactions.

Eliminate Disruption to Traffic or Protocol Transactions

Simplify traffic acquisition and distribution for diverse network monitoring applications including performance management, service delivery management, and security monitoring.
